Hello everyone my name is pujan Neupane. I am currently a High school student and this is my project on open-cv so if you have any suggestions then you could simply change anything you want and use it according to your needs. 

How to use it?
```
Install mediapipe (pip install mediapipe)
Pip install pyautogui
Pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
Install all the required modules and then you will be able to use it without any kind of problem.

Thank you, 

Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
